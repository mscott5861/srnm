## srnm

A deliberately simple ncurses utility that sequentially (and dumbly) renames the files in the directory it's invoked from to whichever string is entered. Useful for bulk renaming things like wallpapers, photos, etc., with basically no learning curve.

## Usage

`cd` to the directory whose files you'd like to rename, and just run `srnm`. Type in the new filename, press `Enter` to rename the files (followed by a confirmation), or `Ctrl+C` to exit the program.

## Installation
