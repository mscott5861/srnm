## srnm

A deliberately simple utility that sequentially (and dumbly) renames the files in the directly it's invoked from to whichever string you enter. Useful for bulk renaming things like wallpapers, photos, etc.

## Usage

`cd` to the directory whose files you'd like to rename, and just run `srnm`. Type in the new filename, press `Enter` to rename the files (followed by a confirmation), or `Ctrl+C` to exit the program.

## Installation
